# rwh_epub
The ePub version of Real World Haskell by Bryan O'Sullivan, Don Stewart, and John Goerzen

Pack them all with zip, rename it to .epub, and enjoy!
Haskell is a magical language, which is no doubt worth of studying.

Thanks to Bryan O'Sullivan, Don Stewart, and John Goerzen.

Thanks to @bgschaid, now we have a more standard epub at <https://keybase.pub/bgschaid/RealWorldHaskell.epub>
